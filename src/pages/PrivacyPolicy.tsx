              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">7.4 Right to restrict processing:</h3>

              <p>If we process your data for legitimate interest, you can object to this data processing at any time; this would also apply to profiling based on these provisions. We will then no longer process your data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.

              <p>Our website uses analysis tools to collect general information about the usage behavior of visitors. This includes, for example, pages viewed, length of visit, referring pages and general information about your computer system such as operating system, screen resolution, browser used, etc. All data collected is stored anonymously and cannot be traced back to you personally.

              <p>This website also uses Google Analytics, an internet analysis service from Google. Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the site.</p>
              
              <p>The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">15. Use of social sharing</h2>
              
              <p>We do not use any plugins from the respective social media services for the social sharing functionalities. Instead, we only use a text or image link. This means that no data, such as your IP address, browser used, screen resolution, the website accessed, date and time, is transmitted to the respective social media services.</p>
              
              <p>Such links may look like this: www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php</p>
              
              <p>If you click on a social sharing link while you are logged into your respective social media account, you can share the content of our pages on your profile. This allows the social media service to associate your visit to our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by social media platforms.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">16. Contact via website</h2>
              
              <p>Due to legal regulations, our website contains information that enables quick electronic contact to our company and direct communication with us, which also includes a general address for so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by email or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject will be stored automatically. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the controller are stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. This personal data is not passed on to third parties.</p>
              
              <p>We use Supabase for our contact form and for sending emails. Supabase helps us manage and store the data you submit through our contact form securely. When you submit information through our contact form, this data is processed and stored on Supabase's servers. Supabase implements strong security measures to protect your data, and we have a data processing agreement in place with them to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">17. Embedding of YouTube videos</h2>
              
              <p>We use the so-called "extended data protection mode" of the provider YouTube to embed videos. This means that a cookie is only stored on your computer when the video is played. According to YouTube, however, no personal cookie information is stored for playbacks of embedded videos with extended data protection. Further information on YouTube's official data protection policy can be found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
              
              <p>If you want to ensure that no data about you is stored by YouTube, do not click on the embedded videos.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">18. Use of Google reCaptcha</h2>
              
              <p>We use the reCAPTCHA service from Google Inc (Google) to protect your orders via the Internet form. The query serves to differentiate whether the input is made by a human or abusively by automated, machine processing. The query includes sending the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. For this purpose, your input is transmitted to Google and used there. By using reCaptcha, you agree that the recognition you provide will be used to digitize old works. However, if IP anonymization is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of reCaptcha will not be merged with other Google data. The deviating data protection provisions of Google apply to this data. You can find more information about Google's privacy policy at: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
              
              <p>Our implementation includes enhanced reCAPTCHA validation with fallback mechanisms to ensure form functionality even if reCAPTCHA services are temporarily unavailable, while maintaining security standards.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">19. Use of Google Maps</h2>
              
              <p>This website uses the "Google Maps API" of Google Inc (Google) for the visual display of maps. When Google Maps is used, Google also collects, processes and uses data about the use of the Maps functions by visitors to the website. The terms of use for Google Maps can be found at Terms of Use for Google Maps. Further information on Google's privacy policy can be found at: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">20. Google Tag Manager</h2>
              
              <p>This website uses Google Tag Manager. This service allows website tags to be managed via an interface. The Google Tool Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are used and no personal data is collected. The Google Tool Manager triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. However, the Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been carried out at domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags, provided that these are implemented with the Google Tag Manager.</p>
